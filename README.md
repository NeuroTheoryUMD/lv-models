## lv-models

This repo contains a collection of latent variable models used for modeling neural data. For an example use case, see our paper entitled
"Revealing unobserved factors underlying cortical activity with a rectified latent variable model applied to neural population recordings"
in [Journal of Neurophysiology](http://jn.physiology.org/content/117/3/919.full) or the preprint in [bioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/29/072173)
